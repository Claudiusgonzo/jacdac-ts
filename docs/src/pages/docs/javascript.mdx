## JavaScript usage

Import the library in your Typescript project.

```javascript
import * from 'jacdac-ts'
```

### Connect to the bus

You will need to connect to the JACDAC bus via WebUSB. This needs to be done from a user action, like a click,
for security reasons.

```javascript
const jd = jacdac.createUSBBus();
await jd.connectAsync();
```

### Devices

Once you have the bus connected, you can register to events when device get connected or disconnected.

```javascript
jd.on('deviceConnect', dev => console.log(`connect ${dev}`)
jd.on('deviceDisconnect', dev => console.log(`disconnect ${dev}`)
jd.on('deviceAnnounce', dev => console.log(`announce ${dev}`)
```

Remember that when a device is first connected, it's list of services might not yet be populated. 
This happens later on the ``deviceannounce`` event.

You can get a snapshot of the list of devices from the bus.

```javascript
const devices = jd.devices()
```

See [/tools] for example of vanilla HTML/JavaScript pages using the library.
