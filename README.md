 - Tests, coverage and interactive watch mode using **[Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/)**
 - **[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)** and **[TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/)** for code formatting and consistency
 - **Docs automatic generation and deployment** to `gh-pages`, using **[TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/)**
 - Automatic types `(*.d.ts)` file generation
 - **[Travis](https://travis-ci.org)** integration and **[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/)** report
 - (Optional) **Automatic releases and changelog**, using [Semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), [Conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) and [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) (for the git hooks)

### Importing library

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import myLib from 'mylib'
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `dist/lib` in case you have a modular library:

```javascript
import something from 'mylib/dist/lib/something'
```

### NPM scripts

 - `npm t`: Run test suite
 - `npm start`: Run `npm run build` in watch mode
 - `npm run test:watch`: Run test suite in [interactive watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/cli.html#watch)
 - `npm run test:prod`: Run linting and generate coverage
 - `npm run build`: Generate bundles and typings, create docs
 - `npm run lint`: Lints code
 - `npm run commit`: Commit using conventional commit style ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will tell you to use it if you haven't :wink:)
